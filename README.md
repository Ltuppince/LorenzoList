# Lorenzo's List  
Lorenzo's List is a web application where the user can view,
add, and delete items for sale, all in one clean package.  

The user must be logged in, in order to interact with the items posted
in the database.  This helps to alleviate the anonymity of buying things online.

After logging in, the user is then redirected to the user's page.  From there, it's a one-stop shop
for whatever the user plans to do.
