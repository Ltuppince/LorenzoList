# Lorenzo's List  
Lorenzo's List is a web application where the user can view,
add, and delete items for sale, all in one clean package.  

The user must be logged in, in order to interact with the items posted
in the database.  This helps to alleviate the anonymity of buying things online.

### Uses and How to Use  
When navigating to the page, the user is first directed to the Sign Up page.  
If the user already already has an account, he/she may simply click the link to the login page.  

After logging in, the user is then redirected to the user's page.  From there, it's a one-stop shop
for whatever the user plans to do.  

The user can view/delete the items he/she posted, view items for sale or post new items.  

When viewing items, the user has the option to sort the items by category.  The user may also click
an item card to view the entire post.
