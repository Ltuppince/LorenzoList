37,05 Chevy Trailblazer LT,650,https://images.craigslist.org/00D0D_l6arEA1FyqF_600x450.jpg,"The bad: I believe the transmission is bad (it only moves in reverse, no forward gears), body and interior in rough shape, windshield cracked, leaky rack & pinion, no front drive shaft (took off to save on gas and lost it). Will most likely have to tow away.

The Good: 4.2L Vortec 4200 motor well maintained  and runs great, Radiator and coolant hoses replaced a year ago, Rear axle replaced with rebuilt a couple of months ago, new brake pads/rotors (less than 1 yr.), rear tires replaced last summer and are lightly worn, 4WD and AWD still work to my knowledge (front driveshaft missing), good silver battery (less than 3 yrs old), clean title.

To sum it up the truck has less than 170,000 miles, the motor is good and it still has a lot of deceit salvageable parts in and out. Roof rack is included. Title is clean.

Need it sold soon so all reasonable offers will be considered.
