The subs and amp absolutely HIT, I have to keep the sub turned to -4 on my head unit because its to much for me. All in for the subs with the box, the amp and install, it cost me over $2000. Im asking $900 for the whole set up. Everything was bought from and professionally installed by audio one in Newport News, VA. Please do research on these subs and amp before you hmu and offer me something ridiculous they are worth the price hands down. These are competition level subs and amp.

7,Crypto Litecoin Mining Rig Ready to go!,1600,https://images.craigslist.org/01111_5EwFtiv1cUz_600x450.jpg,"FutureBit Apollo 5x Miners FULL SET UP -HIGH EFFICIENCY ASIC Miner for Litecoin. Mined for a few months with no reduction in hash power and consistent efficiency (ran in ""Eco-mode"" so hardware is in perfect shape.  These things produce almost no heat so perfect for mining in the summer.  Theyre not as fast as your typical ASIC tube but they are quieter and more efficient.. and a perfect mining rig for a beginner... just plug and play - I can assist with set up, you just need to make an account on litecoinpool.org and plug in an ethernet and your good to go.  They can run wireless which is the best part, you can put them anywhere in the house.  Mining rig comes with four batch-1 apollos and one batch-2 (light doesnt work on batch 2 but the batch 2's are better- futurebit said theyd repair/replace it but its been running fine so I never sent it in.  All apollos come with the mining OS software already flashed and installed so no need to adjust any script in order to start mining.  This 5 unit miner comes with a 1200 Watt power supply which hits optimal efficiency.  It also includes power cords and literally everything you need to start mining.  I can help you get things rolling if your new to mining.  Overall a great deal that will continue to mine for years.  You really cant beat plug and play with 500 MH/s for 500-600W.  And if you really wanna crank these things each unit can go up to 250-400 MH/s with the right tuning (Experienced users only - but I can give some level of guidance).

Get this thing now while its hot... I have to sell them because my circuit is overloaded and Im trying to downsize. But come summer time these things will run cool as a mofo

Please no low ball offers... if you want to start earning crypto this miner is for you!

The Nikon D90 is one of the most popular digital cameras to date with the cameras being used daily by photographers of all abilities, all over the world.  Although an older camera that was first introduced in 2008, the camera is still revenant in today’s every changing digital world, because Nikon was able to get the camera right the first time around and did not to tweak the camera with various upgrades every year.  While the technical specifications may be lagging behind newer cameras, the Nikon D90 still captures outstanding images in a fast, lightweight, user-friendly and economical camera body.

The heart of the D90 is the 12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor in the DX format, which is the brand name that Nikon has given the cropped sensor format.  As with all cropped sensor cameras, the D90 uses a smaller sensor, which costs less to manufacture and is the key to cameras at this price point.  In the case of the D90, the sensor measures 23.6mm x 15.8mm.  While cheaper to manufacture, these smaller sensors are very capable of capturing outstanding images in a wide variety of lighting situations.

Photographers of all abilities and levels of experience will appreciate the ability to shoot using one of the advanced scene modes, which include close–up, landscape, night portrait, portrait and sports.  In these settings, the camera has optimized the camera’s settings for these types of shots, allowing the photographer to concentrate on composition.  In addition, the D90 has various traditional modes as well, including aperture-priority auto (A), auto, auto (flash off), manual, programmed auto and shutter-priority auto (S).  The advantage of this is that the photographer can grow with the camera as their skills develop.

The Nikon D90 has the unique distinction of being the first DSLR to incorporate video capabilities.  The video formats include HD 1,290 x 720 at 24 frames per second and VGA 640 x 424 at 24 frames per second.  The video function is intuitive and easy to use, with the video quality being quite good.",like new
