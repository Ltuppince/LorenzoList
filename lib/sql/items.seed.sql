Will most likely have to tow away.

The Good: 4.2L Vortec 4200 motor well maintained  and runs great, Radiator and coolant hoses replaced a year ago, Rear axle replaced with rebuilt a couple of months ago, new brake pads/rotors (less than 1 yr.), rear tires replaced last summer and are lightly worn, 4WD and AWD still work to my knowledge (front driveshaft missing), good silver battery (less than 3 yrs old), clean title.

To sum it up the truck has less than 170,000 miles, the motor is good and it still has a lot of deceit salvageable parts in and out. Roof rack is included. Title is clean.

Need it sold soon so all reasonable offers will be considered.

Mined for a few months with no reduction in hash power and consistent efficiency (ran in Eco-mode so hardware is in perfect shape.  These things produce almost no heat so perfect for mining in the summer.  Theyre not as fast as your typical ASIC tube but they are quieter and more efficient.. and a perfect mining rig for a beginner... just plug and play - I can assist with set up, you just need to make an account on litecoinpool.org and plug in an ethernet and your good to go.  They can run wireless which is the best part, you can put them anywhere in the house.  Mining rig comes with four batch-1 apollos and one batch-2 (light doesnt work on batch 2 but the batch 2's are better- futurebit said theyd repair/replace it but its been running fine so I never sent it in.  All apollos come with the mining OS software already flashed and installed so no need to adjust any script in order to start mining.  This 5 unit miner comes with a 1200 Watt power supply which hits optimal efficiency.  It also includes power cords and literally everything you need to start mining.  I can help you get things rolling if your new to mining.  Overall a great deal that will continue to mine for years.  You really cant beat plug and play with 500 MH/s for 500-600W.  And if you really wanna crank these things each unit can go up to 250-400 MH/s with the right tuning (Experienced users only - but I can give some level of guidance).

Get this thing now while its hot... I have to sell them because my circuit is overloaded and Im trying to downsize. But come summer time these things will run cool as a mofo

Please no low ball offers... if you want to start earning crypto this miner is for you!

Please view this website for more details on the camera’s features or google Nikon D90:  https://thecameraguide.org/nikon-d90/

The Nikon D90 is one of the most popular digital cameras to date with the cameras being used daily by photographers of all abilities, all over the world.  Although an older camera that was first introduced in 2008, the camera is still revenant in today’s every changing digital world, because Nikon was able to get the camera right the first time around and did not to tweak the camera with various upgrades every year.  While the technical specifications may be lagging behind newer cameras, the Nikon D90 still captures outstanding images in a fast, lightweight, user-friendly and economical camera body.

The heart of the D90 is the 12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor in the DX format, which is the brand name that Nikon has given the cropped sensor format.  As with all cropped sensor cameras, the D90 uses a smaller sensor, which costs less to manufacture and is the key to cameras at this price point.  In the case of the D90, the sensor measures 23.6mm x 15.8mm.  While cheaper to manufacture, these smaller sensors are very capable of capturing outstanding images in a wide variety of lighting situations.

Photographers of all abilities and levels of experience will appreciate the ability to shoot using one of the advanced scene modes, which include close–up, landscape, night portrait, portrait and sports.  In these settings, the camera has optimized the camera’s settings for these types of shots, allowing the photographer to concentrate on composition.  In addition, the D90 has various traditional modes as well, including aperture-priority auto (A), auto, auto (flash off), manual, programmed auto and shutter-priority auto (S).  The advantage of this is that the photographer can grow with the camera as their skills develop.

The Nikon D90 has the unique distinction of being the first DSLR to incorporate video capabilities.  The video formats include HD 1,290 x 720 at 24 frames per second and VGA 640 x 424 at 24 frames per second.  The video function is intuitive and easy to use, with the video quality being quite good.", "635");

-	Want to avoid repressive yard-sign early posting restrictions?
-	Want a last minute surprise with a 25 van caravan/convoy circling town?
Then… GET YOUR CAMPAIGN ROLLING & WIN BIGLY WITH LARGE-FORMAT 4’x8‘ POLITICAL SIGNS!
Dwarf your opponent’s yard signs with your rolling 4’x8’ signs out on the road today and every day until election.  Get thousands of eye-level views every hour, instead of the same neighborhood locals driving in front of your house or your neighbor’s house.
Start getting your photo, name, office and slogan out on the street NOW, with full-color 48” x 96” (4’ x 8’) VanBanners.  Mount one or both side(s) of your van, your neighbor’s van, or any van that runs.  Our full-color political banners will make old vans look new again.
We will design your layout, and up-size it to 4x8’ for printing for only $72.00.  If you want to avoid the $72.00, up-size fee, with your own print-ready art file, make sure it is exactly 4'x8' in size and at least 169DPI. Otherwise, let us design something AWESOME FOR ONLY $72.00.  We have 20 Years of professional design experience in the design and print industry!
We will ship the 4x8 large format vinyl banner(s) to you with mounting brackets you need to mount it.  ($149.00 + $14.95 S&H)  In less than 5 days, after you approve the layout with our graphic design department.  Do two (2) vans or double side a van $259.00 +$18.95 S&H) Got more vans… Call us for special rates on 3 Banners or more.
Don’t stop with just your own van or your neighbor’s van… Have everyone you know with a van mount your political banner on their van and let them help drive your campaign over the top…   How about all your friends who said “they would do anything you ask, to help your campaign…”  Why not have them sponsor a person who owns and usually drives a van?  They can offer to pay the van owner/driver as their campaign contribution.  Just forward this post to them, they will get the idea if they really want you or their favorite presidential candidate to win.
No matter what you’re running for Dog Catcher or President, this is the way to WIN Bigly (Big League), by taking it to the streets, where fines for early campaign sign posting(s), more than 30 days prior to the election, can’t prevent you from getting the jump on your opponents.
Live in a condo or HOA that restricts signs on parked vehicles?  Take it off when you get home, put it back on when you leave.

Price is $3000 for everything or best offer (14 cabinets, 4 appliances, 2 granite countertops, 2 sinks). No low ball offers. 

*Only selling all appliances together, no individual sales.

Text or call for more details. Thank you!", "784");

I am asking for an adoption fee but my preference will be someone who knows how to care for fish over someone able to offer more. I have two tanks - a 10 gallon with a male betta and a 20 gallon with 5 cloud mountain minnows and 2 upside-down catfish. 

10 gallon with Blue Male Betta
Comes with:

Short list:
Male blue betta (his name is Bellamy but I have a feeling he doesn't know it so feel free to give him a new one)
Elive Aqua Duo 10 Gallon tank
Glass top
Elive filter (with live plant option)
Cascade 300 filter 
1 extra filter cartridge 
Decky aquarium light (adjustable + customizable)   + remote
50 W Heater w/ guard
Thermometer 
Ceramic bridge decor 
Bioactive substrate 
Two anubias 
Long tweezers
Stress coat+ (makes tap water safe)
Extra light 
Timer (not sure if this works)
3 betta food varieties 
Vacation feeders (I don't recommend these save for emergencies - if you can get someone to care for your fish that's best) 
Net 
Tank siphon Vacuum

Longer explanations of items:

Dimensiona of the tank are (in inches) 20l, 11 3/4h, 10 1/4w

The Elive filter has Expanded clay as media. You can take off the top and Plant a fish-safe plant (for example bamboo, wheatgrass, basil, peace lily, pothos, Arrowhead plant [happy to offer a cutting of this] lucky bamboo, thyme, catnip, mint, cilantro, peppers, green beans, lettuce, micro greens, and more) which will remove pollutants from the water and act as a natural filter. 

I personally felt that wouldn't be enough filtration so I added the Cascade 300 with physical, chemical, and biological underwater filtration. It also ensures there's not too much current for delicate fish like Bettas since you can turn the output to the glass. 

Long tweezers (for planting or moving lighter things mostly)

Thermometer (simple sticker kind)

Heater 

Deckey aquarium light RGB Multi-color LED lights for 14.8-20.6incg fish tank extendable light 36LED 8W + IR Remote controller 
(this is a really nice light. It has sooooo many options for color and brightness and patterns. I tend to only use a white or yellow light and on special occasions the slow changing of colors. I think the crazy strobe stuff would be stressful for the fish so I don't recommend using those settings on the tank.)

His current foods are pellets, flakes, and longer bits. He isn't too fond of freeze dried bloodworms suprisingly but likes other treats.

Tank siphon vacuum - for cleaning 

I have paper on the back of the tank to make things look more finished and stop light from getting in from behind. It's easily removable.  

Unfortunately Bellamy does have torn fins at the moment from a mishap with Seiryu stone (which has since been removed from his tank) but he is recovering quickly with medication.

Please message me if you're interested and have an offer. This would be everything needed. Willing to drive to a public space near you.

Ideally looking for people who either have done research or already have fish experience and are willing to put in maintenance to take care of these beautiful little creatures.", "846");

The 20gallon tank comes with 
Short list:

5 cloud mountain minnows and 2 upside-down catfish 
20 gallon tank 
Stand
Aqua-tech 20-40 filter
1 extra filter cartridge 
Seachem flourish glue 
Wooden fake tree on stone
Red Lavarock 
A few live plants 
Aquarium air pump (good for shrimp) 
Seachem Prime - concentrated conditioner for marine and freshwater 500ml/16.9fl oz
Seachem stress guard 500ml/16.9fl oz
Seachem stability - new tank stabilization system for marine and freshwater 500ml/16.9fl oz
Ammonia clear 2 tabs

Long tweezers
24'' fluorescent tank light with cover 
Thermometer 
API Freshwater Master test kit 
Net
Bamboo toothbrush for cleaning 
Topfin algea cleaning razor 
ph down 
3 food types 
Tank siphon vacuum


More explanatory list: 

5 cloud mountain minnows and 2 upside-down catfish. The catfish are at least 10 years old now and they are nocturnal and hide most of the time. The minnows are at least 3 years old - two are the yellow variation. 

20 gallon tank - 24 (l) x 16 1/2 (h) x 12 1/4 (w)
+ Aqua-tech 20-40 filter
+ Stand

All-glass aquarium Inc 24'' fluorescent aquarium reflector/light - 120v, 19 watt, 60hz. These bulbs last for years. Some salt buildup on the clear plastic  but it doesn't effect anything. 

APC power saving surge protector with many timers (this allows you to have the light and whatever else you plug into the 4 slots turn off/on on a timer. Has many timer options.) 

Seachem flourish glue - this is aquarium safe glue if you're doing a little DIY 

Wooden fake tree on stone - if you put moss on this it looks like cute mini tree and is blends in on the lava rock. 

Red Lavarock - this is actually really valuable. Pieces this size go upwards of $50 each at times. I think I got them all for $70. Plants love rooting into them, especially anubias (which don't like actual substrate). 

A few live plants (2 anubias who do not react super well to big water changes so they may be a bit worse for wear.)

Aquarium air pump (good for shrimp and some other fish.)

Seachem Prime - concentrated conditioner for marine and freshwater 500ml/16.9fl oz
Seachem stress guard 500ml/16.9fl oz
Seachem stability - new tank stabilization system for marine and freshwater 500ml/16.9fl oz
Ammonia clear 2 tabs (should only be used in emergencies. Regular water changes and using stability as directed should render this unecessary) 
10 day feeder (should only to be used in emergencies as well, not great on tanks or fish)
3 Seiryu stones (another very valuable hardscaping rock. These are about medium sized.) 
24'' fluorescent tank light with cover 
Thermometer (the sticker kind)
API Freshwater Master test kit (super useful! Also worth $30.)
Net
Bamboo toothbrush for cleaning rocks
Topfin algea cleaning razor 
Ph down liquid
3 food types - shrimp pellets, and two types of tropical flakes 
Tank siphon Vacuum (used to clean the tank) 

I have paper on the back of the tank to make things look more finished and stop light from getting in from behind. It's easily removable.
