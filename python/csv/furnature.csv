61,Kelim Wool Rug 5.5' x 8' by HAY (Danish Designer),300,https://images.craigslist.org/00Q0Q_7IDzCxug213_600x450.jpg,"I am selling my HAY Moire kelim wool rug, 5.5' x 8' for $300—retails for $495 + tax/shipping. HAY is a high-end Danish brand found in stores such as Design Within Reach.

It was only used briefly (maybe 3 months) before I refinished my floors and decided I no longer wanted an area rug.

Pet-free home, exceptionally clean. The rug is basically brand new. The last photo shows it in my own home. The first two are stock photos.
